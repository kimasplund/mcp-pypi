## [2.6.1] - 2025-06-24

### üéâ New Features
- **OSV Vulnerability Integration**: Implemented check_vulnerabilities using Google's OSV database for comprehensive security scanning
- **Package Changelog Retrieval**: Added get_package_changelog method with GitHub releases integration and metadata parsing (limited to 5 releases to avoid token limits)
- **Complete RSS Feed Support**: Implemented all PyPI RSS feeds - packages.xml, updates.xml, and project releases
- **Enhanced HTTP Client**: Added support for POST requests with JSON payloads for OSV API integration
- **Version Parsing Improvements**: Better handling of git commit hashes and pre-release versions

### üîß Improvements
- **Better Error Handling**: Added proper package existence checks before vulnerability scanning
- **XML Content Support**: HTTP client now correctly handles and returns raw XML/RSS content
- **Cache Attribute Fix**: Corrected cache reference from self.cache_manager to self.cache throughout
- **Security Enhancements**: Using defusedxml for safe XML parsing of RSS feeds

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed AttributeError when accessing cache in check_vulnerabilities method
- Fixed RSS feed parsing by properly handling raw XML responses from HTTP client
- Fixed version parsing for packages using git commit hashes
- Added error handling for non-existent packages in vulnerability checks
- Fixed method naming mismatch for RSS feeds (get_packages_feed, get_releases_feed)
- Fixed changelog token limit issue by truncating to 5 releases with 1000 char limit per release

### üìù Documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with latest build/test commands and code patterns
- Enhanced inline documentation for new methods
- Added security best practices for XML parsing

## [2.2.0] - 2025-06-23

### üéâ New Features
- **Enhanced Tool Descriptions**: All tools now have compelling, action-oriented descriptions with emojis for better LLM discoverability
- **Unified CLI**: Single `mcp-pypi` entry point with logical subcommands instead of multiple separate commands
- **Improved Server Description**: FastMCP server now includes an engaging description highlighting key capabilities

### üîß Improvements
- **Better Tool Naming**: Tools clearly indicate they work with "Python packages from PyPI"
- **Rich Examples**: Tool descriptions include practical examples showing expected outputs
- **Consistent Cache TTL**: Default cache duration unified to 1 week (604800 seconds) across all components
- **Enhanced README**: Complete rewrite with emojis, badges, and clear sections for PyPI presentation

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed cache directory initialization when `cache_dir` is None
- Fixed inconsistent cache TTL defaults between CLI and models
- Resolved import errors from removed protocol negotiation utilities

### üìù Documentation
- Added comprehensive CLAUDE.md for AI code assistants
- Created tool_descriptions.py with detailed descriptions for all tools
- Updated all documentation to reflect new CLI structure
- Added clear examples and use cases throughout

### üö® Breaking Changes
- Removed `mcp-pypi-server`, `mcp-pypi-run`, and `mcp-pypi-rpc` entry points
- All functionality now accessible through `mcp-pypi` command with subcommands
- Transport options simplified to "stdio" and "http" (http includes both SSE and streamable-http)

### Migration Guide
- Replace `mcp-pypi-server` with `mcp-pypi serve`
- Replace `mcp-pypi-run --transport stdio` with `mcp-pypi serve --transport stdio`
- HTTP transport now automatically provides both /sse and /mcp endpoints
