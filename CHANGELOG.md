- **Improved Server Description**: FastMCP server now includes an engaging description highlighting key capabilities

### üîß Improvements
- **Better Tool Naming**: Tools clearly indicate they work with "Python packages from PyPI"
- **Rich Examples**: Tool descriptions include practical examples showing expected outputs
- **Consistent Cache TTL**: Default cache duration unified to 1 week (604800 seconds) across all components
- **Enhanced README**: Complete rewrite with emojis, badges, and clear sections for PyPI presentation
